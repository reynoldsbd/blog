Welcome! If you're reading this page, that probably means you have been invited
to join my modded Minecraft server.

This page provides background information and a guide for connecting to the
server. It also includes tips, tricks, and external links to help you along.


# Background

This server uses a modded version of Minecraft called [FTB Infinity Evolved].
Although this modpack is based on a very old version of Minecraft (1.7), I chose
it because it includes a number of individual mods which I personally enjoy but
are impossible to find in more modern packs.

# Getting Started

Since this is a modded server, you cannot connect using the standard desktop
client. Additional software is needed to prepare a local client installation
provisioned with the same list of mods as the server.

These days, the easiest way to get started is to use the [Twitch client], which
is capable of automatically creating a modded Minecraft installation. [This
help article] will show you how to use the client to play

As you are following along, keep the following in mind:

* Pay particular attention to the [*Installing Modpacks or FTB*] section; you
  must follow these instructions to download and launch FTB Infinity Evolved.
* This modpack is very resource intensive. For acceptable performance, you may
  need to increase the maximum amount of memory Minecraft is allowed to use.

Once you have installed and launched the modpack, you must configure your
connection to this server. From the main menu:

1. Click "Multiplayer"
2. Click "Add server"
3. Enter a "Server Name" (can be anything, only seen by you)
4. Enter `reynoldsbd.net` as the "Server Address"
5. Click "Done"
6. Click on the newly-configured multiplayer server, then click "Join Server"

# Troubleshooting

## No Sound

Be sure not to resize or move the Minecraft window until the game has finished
loading. Doing so seems to disrupt part of the game initialization process,
causing audio to fail.
