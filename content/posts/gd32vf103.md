This post serves as a starting point and reference for writing software for the
GD32VF103 MCU from GigaDevice. It contains background information, programming
and flashing guides, and references to official and unofficial sources of
documentation.

My intention is for this to be a living document. From time to time, I will
update it with corrected or additional information. If you notice any errors or
would like to suggest additional content, please open an issue or PR on [the
GitHub repository for this site].

# Background

[GigaDevice] is a Chinese company widely known for flash memory and the GD32
series of ARM microcontrollers. It recently introduced a new family of [RISC-V]
based MCUs known as [GD32V], the first model of which is the GD32VF103. Both the
GD32 and GD32V families are quite similar to the popular [STM32] family of MCUs,
with notably higher performance and, in the case of GD32V, as much as [50% more
power efficient].

The GD32VF103 is based on a new RISC-V implementation developed by [Nuclei
System Technology] called the Bumblebee core. This core has some interesting
characteristics such as branch prediction and advanced interrupt handling
hardware, but mostly its focus seems to be on optimized power consumption.

Notably, the GD32VF103 is currently the cheapest available RISC-V MCU on the
market. It is available on the following development boards:

* [Polos Alef] - $1.49
* [Longan Nano] - $4.90
* [Wio Lite RISC-V] - $6.90

In putting together this post, I used a Polos Alef development board. I believe
this is currently the cheapest available RISC-V dev board available. However,
the information on this page should be equally relevant for any board based on
the GD32VF103.

## Official Documentation

GigaDevice provides datasheets and other technical documentation on a
"microsite" dedicated to GD32 MCUs. Here is a direct link to documentation for
the GD32VF103:

http://www.gd32mcu.com/en/download/0?kw=GD32VF1

The primary source of documentation for working with Nuclei cores (including
Bumblebee) seems to be [this site][riscv-mcu-site], which is not available in
English. However, English translations of *some* of the site's contents are
available [on GitHub][riscv-mcu-site-gh]. Likewise on GitHub are some [Bumblebee
datasheets].

# Firmware Library

For traditional C/C++/ASM development, GigaDevice provides an [open source
firmware library] complete with examples and project templates. The library
includes higher level functions and macros for interfacing with the MCU's
peripherals. It also provides a project template complete with a *Makefile*
demonstrating how to compile and flash firmware.

To use the Makefile included with this library, the [Nuclei RISC-V toolchain]
must be available in your path. Also, at this time, [some modifications] to the
template Makefile are necessary in order to make the project buildable.

# Rust

Support for 32-bit RISC-V IMAC targets has been available on stable Rust for
some time now, and there are several open source crates available which provide
platform initialization and peripheral access.

To get started, enable the approprate Rust target:

```
rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
```

Create a new Cargo binary project and add [*riscv-rt*] as a dependency, then
follow that crate's instructions to set up your project. The result is a minimal
firmware program that boots but does nothing.

To do something interesting, use [*embedded-hal*] and its [surrounding
ecosystem] to access and interact with peripherals and devices. A HAL
implementation for this MCU is provided by [*gd32vf103xx-hal*].

I've put together a [small GitHub repository] with samples illustrating this
approach.

# Flashing with *dfu-util*

<!-- todo: sections for other flashing methodologies (stm32flash, openocd, cargo-flash) -->
<!-- todo: is it possible to overwrite the bootloader? -->

The MCU includes a built-in bootloader that can be used to load new firmware. To
activate the bootloader on a Polos Alef, hold the *BOOT* button while resetting
the device. When in bootloader mode, new firmware can be flashed onto the device
using either [DFU] or a serial connection.

Using DFU is probably the most accessible way to flash, because it only requires
a single USB cable and works on both Windows and Linux. But there's a catch: the
bootloader technically does not comply with the [DFU specification][dfu-spec],
which means the standard [dfu-util][dfu-util] tool will not work.

Instead, you must use [a customized version][gd32-dfu-utils] with support for
the GD32V bootloader.

[DFU]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Device_Firmware_Upgrade
[dfu-spec]: https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/DFU_1.1.pdf
[dfu-util]: http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/
[gd32-dfu-utils]: https://github.com/riscv-mcu/gd32-dfu-utils

## Windows

A prebuilt binary of the customized dfu-util is available for Windows users
under the GitHub Releases section.

As noted on the releases page, Windows users will need to use [Zadig][zadig] to
configure the WinUSB driver.

[zadig]: https://zadig.akeo.ie/

## Other Platforms

Non-Windows users will need to build this tool from source. It's not so hard;
simply follow the instructions in the *INSTALL* file and deal with any missing
dependencies as you go along.

> Hint: On Ubuntu, you'll need to install the following dependency packages:
>
> ```
> build-essential autoconf pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
> ```

<!-- todo: figure out how to use doc/40-dfuse.rules -->

## Usage

Use the following command to flash the MCU. See `dfu-util -h`
for an explanation of these parameters.

```
dfu-util -d 28e9:0189 -a 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000:leave -D path/to/firmware.bin
```
